# Blackjack card game:

My version of Blackjack game.

Blackjack, or twenty-one, Card game whose object is to be dealt cards having a higher count than those of the dealer, up to but not exceeding 21. The dealer may use a single deck of 52 cards or two or more decks from a holder called a shoe. Aces count as 1 or 11, and face cards as 10. 

My version is between one player and the dealer.

The player can either Hit or Stand after which it is Dealers turn.

# How to install and run the game:

I have included an .exe version which will work on windows OS, but it requires to have background image in same directory when it is run ( the image is included in the folder ) 

OR

I have included the code files which also include unit test file and background image.

The game is made in Python and for GUI, I have used Tkinter GUI.

The modules needed to be installed for the code is :

Tkinter:
pip install tk

# Game rules:

Blackjack hands are scored by their point total. The hand with the highest total wins if it does not exceed 21; a hand with a higher total than 21 is said to bust. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, and face cards (jack, queen, king) are also worth 10. An ace's value is 11 unless this would cause the player to bust, in which case it is worth 1.
The goal of each player is to beat the dealer by having the higher, unbusted hand. Note that if the player busts, he loses, even if the dealer also busts (therefore Blackjack favours the dealer). If both the player and the dealer have the same point value, it is called a "push", and neither player nor dealer wins the hand. The player has an independent game with the dealer.
